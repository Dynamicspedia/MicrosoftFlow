# MicrosoftFlow

In this project you will find examples related to Microsoft Flow. You can find instructions how to use the flows on my blog: https://dynamicspedia.com

You are allowed to use, change and distribute the script to your needs. I would appreciate if you don't remove the name of the original author.

To be able to use the Flow, you need to provide your own Azure Active Directory credentials and change the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operation environment on the actions to match the environment where you want to use the automation.
